  "ARTICLE_CONTENT": "<p>The dishwasher started making a grinding noise on a Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>By Thursday, it was leaking.</p>\n\n<p>I knew it was under warranty. We'd bought it fourteen months ago—well within the two-year coverage. I remembered the salesperson at Home Depot pointing at the warranty card, saying \"Keep this safe.\"</p>\n\n<p>I did not keep it safe.</p>\n\n<h2>The Drawer</h2>\n\n<p>You know the drawer. Everyone has one.</p>\n\n<p>Manuals you'll never read. Batteries that might be dead. Random cables. And somewhere in there, supposedly, receipts.</p>\n\n<p>I spent forty-five minutes in that drawer. Found the manual for a TV we no longer own. Found a receipt for a $12 lunch from 2019. Did not find the dishwasher receipt.</p>\n\n<p>Checked my email. Nothing from Home Depot—I must have declined the digital receipt.</p>\n\n<p>Checked my credit card statement. Found the charge: $847. But a credit card statement showing the entry does not match the cost of the item in the retailer's system because it doesn't show what you bought.</p>\n\n<p>Called the store. They asked for the transaction number. I didn't have it. They asked for the exact date. I said \"sometime in October, I think?\" They said they couldn't help.</p>\n\n<h2>The $400 Lesson</h2>\n\n<p>Proof of purchase is required for all warranty claims.</p>\n\n<p>No receipt, no warranty. Doesn't matter that I obviously bought it. Doesn't matter that the serial number is right there on the machine.</p>\n\n<p>Although many companies will attempt to refuse warranty claims made without a receipt, be persistent when contacting the manufacturer. I tried. Called the manufacturer directly. They wanted proof of purchase date. I couldn't provide it.</p>\n\n<p>The repair cost $387.</p>\n\n<p>For a dishwasher that was still under warranty.</p>\n\n<p>Because I couldn't find a piece of paper.</p>\n\n<h2>It's Not Just Warranties</h2>\n\n<p>That dishwasher moment broke something in me. I started thinking about all the other receipts I'd lost:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The laptop charger</strong> that stopped working after three months. Warranty? Probably. Receipt? Gone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The winter coat</strong> that started unraveling at the seams. Return window? Maybe. Receipt? Who knows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The kids' bike helmet</strong> that cracked. Recall? Possibly. Proof of purchase? Somewhere in the drawer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Medical expenses</strong> for the HSA reimbursement I kept meaning to file. Receipts? Scattered across my camera roll, mixed with photos of the dog.</p>\n\n<p>Every lost receipt is money you already spent that you can't get back when something goes wrong.</p>\n\n<h2>The Actual Math</h2>\n\n<p>I sat down and tried to estimate what missing receipts had cost me over the past five years:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dishwasher repair: $387</li>\n<li>Laptop charger I replaced instead of warrantying: $79</li>\n<li>Coat I couldn't return: $180</li>\n<li>HSA reimbursements I never filed: ~$400</li>\n<li>Electronics I threw away instead of returning: ~$150</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Total: $1,196</strong></p>\n\n<p>For receipts. Pieces of paper I had in my hand at some point and then lost.</p>\n\n<h2>The Fix</h2>\n\n<p>The problem wasn't organization. I'd tried organization. Folders. The drawer. A shoebox. A \"receipts\" album on my phone that I used for two weeks and then forgot about.</p>\n\n<p>The problem was friction. Every system required me to do something later—file this, organize that, remember to sort through.</p>\n\n<p>What actually worked: capturing receipts the moment I get them, before I even leave the store.</p>\n\n<p>Now when I buy anything I might need proof of purchase for—appliances, electronics, expensive clothes, kids' gear—I photograph the receipt and text it to TextExpense before I get to my car.</p>\n\n<p>It takes fifteen seconds. The receipt gets extracted, dated, stored. If I ever need it, I search by store name or date and there it is.</p>\n\n<h2>What Changed</h2>\n\n<p>Six months into the new system, our coffee maker died. Eleven months old, still under warranty.</p>\n\n<p>I searched \"coffee maker\" in my receipts. Found it instantly. Sent the image to the manufacturer. Got a replacement shipped in four days.</p>\n\n<p>Total time spent: three minutes.</p>\n\n<p>That's the difference between $0 and $200. Between a replacement and a repurchase. Between \"warranty honored\" and \"sorry, we can't help you.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Not Just for Business</h2>\n\n<p>Most receipt apps are built for business expenses and tax deductions. But receipts matter for life too:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warranties</strong> on appliances, electronics, furniture</li>\n<li><strong>Returns</strong> within the window</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance claims</strong> when something gets stolen or damaged</li>\n<li><strong>HSA/FSA reimbursements</strong> for medical expenses</li>\n<li><strong>Price adjustments</strong> when something goes on sale after you bought it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Every purchase over $50 is worth capturing. You never know when you'll need proof.</p>\n\n<h2>Stop paying for things twice.</h2>\n\n<p>TextExpense gives you 3 free receipts to try. Next time you buy something with a warranty, text the receipt before you leave the store.</p>\n\n<p>Future you will be grateful.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wa.me/17654792054?text=hi\" class=\"cta-link\">Try It Free →</a></p>",
