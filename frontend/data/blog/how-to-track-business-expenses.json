  "ARTICLE_CONTENT": "<p class=\"lead\">Your business bank account shows money going out. Lots of it. But tracking where it's actually going? That's the part nobody does consistently.</p>\n\n<p>Office supplies from last week. Client lunch from yesterday. That software subscription from three months ago. They're all in there somewhere, buried in your transaction history.</p>\n\n<p>Come tax time or when you need to review your spending, you're scrambling through months of receipts trying to piece together what you bought and why.</p>\n\n<p>Small businesses waste 8-12 hours monthly on expense tracking and bookkeeping. That's time you could spend actually running your business.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Business Expense Tracking Actually Matters</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond the obvious tax reasons, here's what happens when you don't track expenses:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You're bleeding money without knowing it.</strong> That $50 monthly subscription you forgot about? That's $600 yearly. Multiply that across multiple subscriptions and unnecessary expenses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tax deductions disappear.</strong> Can't find the receipt? Can't claim the deduction. The average small business misses $2,000-3,000 in legitimate deductions annually.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cash flow becomes a mystery.</strong> You know money is leaving, but where? Without tracking, you're flying blind on one of your most important business metrics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Audits become nightmares.</strong> The IRS wants documentation. If you can't produce receipts and records, you're paying penalties on top of losing deductions.</p>\n\n<h2>What You Need to Track</h2>\n\n<p>Every business expense that's \"ordinary and necessary\" for your work:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Operating expenses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Office rent and utilities</li>\n  <li>Equipment and supplies</li>\n  <li>Software and subscriptions</li>\n  <li>Insurance premiums</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>People costs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Employee wages and benefits</li>\n  <li>Contractor payments</li>\n  <li>Professional services (accountant, lawyer)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Business development:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Marketing and advertising</li>\n  <li>Business meals (with clients)</li>\n  <li>Travel expenses</li>\n  <li>Networking events</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicle expenses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Mileage or actual car expenses</li>\n  <li>Parking and tolls</li>\n  <li>Vehicle maintenance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep receipts for everything. Even purchases under $75 need documentation.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Traditional Tracking Methods Fail</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - Manually entering every expense with date, merchant, amount, category. It's accurate but time-consuming. After a few weeks, you're behind and never catch up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shoebox method</strong> - Collect receipts all month, sort them later. Except \"later\" means spending your Saturday trying to remember what that faded receipt from March was for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Business banking alone</strong> - Your statement shows amounts and dates but not what you bought or why. The IRS needs more detail.</p>\n\n<p>The problem: these systems demand consistent effort when you're already busy running a business.</p>\n\n<h2>The Approach That Works</h2>\n\n<p>Handle each expense immediately - the moment you get the receipt. Takes 30 seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Take a photo</strong> (or forward email receipts)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Text it to a number</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Choose:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Track it as a business expense</strong> - system captures merchant, date, amount, category. Perfect for recurring expenses and tax deductions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Just save it</strong> - describe it and store for later. Great for major equipment purchases, vendor contracts, or expenses you're not sure about yet.</p>\n\n<p>Done. No weekend catch-up sessions. No spreadsheet nightmares.</p>\n\n<h2>How This Solves Real Business Problems</h2>\n\n<h3>Tax Time Without the Panic</h3>\n\n<p>Throughout the year, text expenses as they happen. When your accountant needs records, generate an Excel report with everything categorized and documented.</p>\n\n<p>Office expenses, meals, travel, equipment - all organized with downloadable receipt links.</p>\n\n<h3>Actually Understanding Your Spending</h3>\n\n<p>Monthly reports show where money goes by category. Spending too much on subscriptions? The data shows it clearly.</p>\n\n<p>Make informed decisions about cutting costs or allocating resources based on actual numbers, not guesses.</p>\n\n<h3>Employee Reimbursements Simplified</h3>\n\n<p>Employees text receipts after business purchases. Everything's in one place. Process reimbursements with proper documentation instead of chasing people for missing receipts.</p>\n\n<h3>Vendor Documentation You Can Find</h3>\n\n<p>Need that equipment receipt for the warranty claim? Search for it, download it, done. No digging through files or hoping you saved it somewhere.</p>\n\n<h3>Audit-Ready Records</h3>\n\n<p>If the IRS comes knocking, generate reports for any time period with all supporting documentation. Everything organized, dated, downloadable.</p>\n\n<h2>What Gets Captured</h2>\n\n<p><strong>For business expenses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Merchant name and location</li>\n  <li>Purchase date</li>\n  <li>Amount and tax</li>\n  <li>Category (office supplies, meals, travel, etc.)</li>\n  <li>Original receipt image</li>\n  <li>Notes field for business purpose</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>For items you're just saving:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Description and category</li>\n  <li>Stored with upload date</li>\n  <li>Downloadable when needed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Reports Your Business Needs</h2>\n\n<p>Generate monthly, quarterly, or annual reports:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Expense summary</strong> - total spending by category<br>\n<strong>Detail reports</strong> - individual transactions<br>\n<strong>Category analysis</strong> - spending trends<br>\n<strong>Receipt access</strong> - download any original</p>\n\n<p>Perfect for bookkeeping, tax prep, financial analysis, budget planning.</p>\n\n<h2>Common Questions</h2>\n\n<h3>Can I track personal and business separately?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Keep them separate for clean bookkeeping.</p>\n\n<h3>What about recurring subscriptions?</h3>\n<p>Track them once, they're documented. Easy to see all subscriptions in one place.</p>\n\n<h3>Do I need separate business accounts?</h3>\n<p>Highly recommended. Makes everything cleaner and protects you legally.</p>\n\n<h3>Can multiple team members use this?</h3>\n<p>Absolutely. Great for tracking team expenses.</p>\n\n<h3>What if I'm behind on tracking?</h3>\n<p>Start now with this week's expenses. Don't try to catch up on months of backlog - just stay current going forward.</p>\n\n<h2>What This Costs</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Try 3 business expenses free.</strong> No credit card.</p>\n\n<p>Then:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Light plan:</strong> $2.99/month for 6 expenses</li>\n  <li><strong>Pro plan:</strong> $4.99/month for 25 expenses</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Compare that to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>8-12 hours monthly doing manual bookkeeping (what's your hourly rate?)</li>\n  <li>$2,000-3,000 in missed tax deductions</li>\n  <li>Late fees and penalties from disorganization</li>\n  <li>The stress of never knowing where money goes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even saving 5 hours monthly makes this worthwhile.</p>\n\n<h2>Stop Wasting Time on Business Bookkeeping</h2>\n\n<p>You started a business to do work you care about. Not to spend evenings entering expenses into spreadsheets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Text expenses when they happen. Get organized reports when you need them. Save hours every month.</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Set up a simple system today. Text just this week's expenses. Once the habit sticks, you'll never fall behind again.</p>\n</blockquote>",
