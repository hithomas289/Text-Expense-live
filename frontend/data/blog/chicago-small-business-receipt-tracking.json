Keep it simple for easier bookkeeping.</li>\n    <li><strong>Set a monthly reminder.</strong> Download your Excel report on the 1st of each month. Hand to bookkeeper or file for taxes.</li>\n    <li><strong>Track parking meters separately.</strong> Chicago has lots of parking expenses.

Text those receipts too.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>",
