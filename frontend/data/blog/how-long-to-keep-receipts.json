  "ARTICLE_CONTENT": "<p class=\"lead\">You're staring at a pile of receipts from 2019. Can you throw them out yet? What about that equipment purchase from 2021? Or receipts from last month?</p>\n\n<p>The standard answer is \"keep everything for 3 years.\" But like most IRS rules, it's more complicated than that. Different receipts have different retention requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Toss them too early and you're in trouble during an audit. Keep them too long and you're drowning in paper. Here's what you actually need to know.</p>\n\n<h2>The Basic IRS Rule (With Important Exceptions)</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Standard answer: 3 years minimum</strong></p>\n\n<p>The IRS has 3 years from when you file to audit your return. Keep receipts and tax records for at least 3 years from your filing date.</p>\n\n<p>Filed your 2024 taxes on April 15, 2025? Keep those receipts until April 15, 2028.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But that's just the minimum.</strong> Several situations require longer retention.</p>\n\n<h2>When You Need to Keep Receipts Longer</h2>\n\n<p><strong>7 years is the safest general rule:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The IRS recommends 7 years for most business tax records. Here's why:</p>\n\n<p><strong>6 years if you underreported income</strong> - If you didn't report more than 25% of your gross income, the IRS has 6 years to audit (not 3).</p>\n\n<p><strong>7 years for bad debt or worthless securities</strong> - If you claimed losses from bad debt or worthless securities, keep records for 7 years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Indefinitely for some situations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Never filed a tax return (keep everything)</li>\n  <li>Filed a fraudulent return (keep everything)</li>\n  <li>Employment tax records (4 years minimum)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>For major purchases and assets:</strong><br>\nProperty records, equipment purchases, stock transactions - keep these for 7+ years or until you sell the asset plus 3 years.</p>\n\n<h2>Different Receipts, Different Rules</h2>\n\n<p>Not all receipts are equal. Here's how long to keep different types:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regular business expenses (3 years minimum):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Office supplies</li>\n  <li>Business meals</li>\n  <li>Travel expenses</li>\n  <li>Software subscriptions</li>\n  <li>Marketing costs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Major purchases (7 years or more):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Equipment and machinery</li>\n  <li>Vehicles for business use</li>\n  <li>Property improvements</li>\n  <li>Significant inventory purchases</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Personal receipts for itemized deductions (3-7 years):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Charitable donations</li>\n  <li>Medical expenses</li>\n  <li>Property taxes</li>\n  <li>Mortgage interest</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Receipts you should keep indefinitely:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Major home improvements (affects basis when you sell)</li>\n  <li>Property purchase documents</li>\n  <li>Investment purchases (until sold + 7 years)</li>\n  <li>Retirement account contributions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Digital Storage Solution</h2>\n\n<p>Here's the problem with \"keep receipts for 7 years\": paper receipts fade, get damaged, or disappear long before 7 years.</p>\n\n<p>The IRS fully accepts digital receipts. Store them digitally and you never worry about:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Faded thermal paper receipts</li>\n  <li>Lost or damaged documents</li>\n  <li>Physical storage space</li>\n  <li>Figuring out what to keep or toss</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What If You Can't Find Old Receipts?</h2>\n\n<p>If you get audited and can't produce receipts, you're not automatically doomed:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can reconstruct expenses</strong> from:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Bank and credit card statements</li>\n  <li>Canceled checks</li>\n  <li>Invoices and contracts</li>\n  <li>Emails and correspondence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Cohan Rule</strong> allows the IRS to estimate reasonable expenses even without receipts, though this isn't guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But it's way better to just have the receipts.</strong> Proving expenses without documentation is stressful and you'll likely lose some deductions.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Actually Manage Retention</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of worrying about which receipts to keep and for how long, here's the simple approach:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Store everything digitally immediately:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The moment you get a receipt - text a photo. It's stored digitally and you never think about it again.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it's a receipt you'll need for 3 years or 7 years or indefinitely, it's just stored. No decisions needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For business:</strong><br>\nStore all business expenses as you go. When 7 years pass, you can delete if you want - but digital storage is cheap, so why bother?</p>\n\n<p><strong>For personal:</strong><br>\nMajor purchases, medical expenses, donations - store them all. Search and download when needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For everything else:</strong><br>\nIf you're not sure, store it. Digital storage doesn't take up physical space and you'll thank yourself later.</p>\n\n<h2>When Can You Actually Delete Receipts?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Conservative approach (recommended):</strong><br>\nKeep business receipts for 7 years, personal receipts for 7 years, major purchases indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minimum legal requirement:</strong><br>\n3 years for most tax-related receipts, unless the exceptions above apply to you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practical answer:</strong><br>\nWith digital storage, why delete? Keep everything and never worry about retention periods again.</p>\n\n<h2>What About Old Paper Receipts?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Already have boxes of old paper receipts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check the dates. If they're more than 7 years old and not related to property or investments, you're probably safe to shred them.</p>\n\n<p>If they're less than 7 years old, consider scanning or photographing the important ones before tossing.</p>\n\n<p>Going forward, store new receipts digitally so you never face this cleanup project again.</p>\n\n<h2>Common Questions</h2>\n\n<h3>Do I really need to keep receipts for purchases under $75?</h3>\n<p>Yes, if you're claiming them as deductions. The \"under $75\" rule means you don't always need the receipt at the time of purchase, but you still need to track and document the expense.</p>\n\n<h3>What about receipts that have faded?</h3>\n<p>If the ink has faded and they're tax-related receipts within your retention period, you're in trouble. This is why digital storage from the start is crucial.</p>\n\n<h3>Can I store everything in a single folder?</h3>\n<p>Technically yes, but organizing by year and category makes life much easier when you need to find something specific.</p>\n\n<h3>What if my accountant asks for receipts?</h3>\n<p>Generate reports showing all receipts for the relevant period. Download specific receipts as needed.</p>\n\n<h2>What This Costs vs. What You Risk</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Try storing 3 receipts free.</strong> No credit card.</p>\n\n<p>Then:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Light plan:</strong> $2.99/month for 6 receipts</li>\n  <li><strong>Pro plan:</strong> $4.99/month for 25 receipts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Compare the risk:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>IRS audits without proper documentation = thousands in lost deductions and penalties</li>\n  <li>Missing receipts for major purchases = lost warranty claims</li>\n  <li>Faded paper receipts = can't prove expenses you legitimately made</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Digital storage for a few dollars monthly is simple insurance.</p>\n\n<h2>Stop Worrying About Retention Periods</h2>\n\n<p>You don't need to remember complex IRS rules about 3 years vs 6 years vs 7 years vs indefinite retention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Store receipts digitally when you get them. Keep them as long as you want. Search and download when needed.</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're reading this because you have old receipts and don't know what to keep - anything more than 7 years old can probably go (unless it's property/investment related). Going forward, store everything digitally and never face this question again.</p>\n</blockquote>",
