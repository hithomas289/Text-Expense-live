  "ARTICLE_CONTENT": "<p>You drove 847 miles last week. You know exactly how much Uber paid you.</p>\n\n<p>But do you know how much you left on the table?</p>\n\n<p>As a self-employed worker, deducting business expenses is critical to lower your taxes. The problem? Most drivers only claim the obvious stuff and miss hundreds (sometimes thousands) in legitimate write-offs.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the complete list.</p>\n\n<h2>The Big One: Mileage</h2>\n\n<p>The largest tax deduction for most Uber drivers is the business use of a car.</p>\n\n<p>For 2025, the IRS standard mileage rate is $0.70 per mile.</p>\n\n<p>That means 1,000 business miles = $700 off your taxable income.</p>\n\n<p>But here's what Uber and Lyft don't track: miles you drove waiting for a trip, the mileage you drove after dropping off passengers if you're waiting for another ride, and the mileage you drove before rides were canceled.</p>\n\n<p>Those miles count. Track them.</p>\n\n<h2>The Deductions Most Drivers Miss</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Your phone bill.</strong> You can deduct your phone plan's cost as a business expense—the portion used for business. If you use your phone 40% for rideshare, that's 40% of your bill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phone accessories.</strong> Car chargers, cables, and phone holders are all tax deductible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Car washes.</strong> Writing off your car mats, cleaning supplies and cleaning services, including car washes, is totally legit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Passenger goodies.</strong> You can deduct the complimentary goodies that you offer your passengers like bottled waters, mints, and Halloween candy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music subscriptions.</strong> Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Sirius XM, and other subscriptions used to entertain passengers are write-offs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dashcams.</strong> Dashcams that are used as a security precaution are deductible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roadside assistance.</strong> A percentage of the fees for AAA or other roadside assistance programs are tax deductible based on the percentage of miles you drive for work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicle inspections.</strong> Vehicle inspections and background checks that are required for work are deductible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Apps you pay for.</strong> Any work-related apps, including for navigation and taxes, can be written off.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tolls and parking.</strong> Already paid through Uber? Still check—some aren't reimbursed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Oil changes and repairs.</strong> Oil changes, repairs, and regular checkups are all tax-deductible if you drive for work.</p>\n\n<h2>The Catch: You Need Receipts</h2>\n\n<p>Here's where most drivers blow it.</p>\n\n<p>It is critical to track all these expenses and keep your receipts so you can claim all the deductions you deserve. You need to have detailed records to back up your claims.</p>\n\n<p>No receipt? No deduction. The IRS doesn't accept \"I remember buying it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Every receipt you lose or misplace could be costing you money on your taxes. Especially because companies like Uber and Lyft can't do it for you.</p>\n\n<h2>The 30-Second Fix</h2>\n\n<p>You're in and out of your car all day. You don't have time for complicated expense apps.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what works: photograph every receipt the moment you get it and text it via WhatsApp to TextExpense.</p>\n\n<p>Gas station? Snap it before you start driving. Car wash? Snap it before you pull out. Phone charger from Amazon? Forward the email receipt.</p>\n\n<p>At tax time, download one Excel file with everything organized—mileage-related expenses, phone costs, supplies, all categorized and ready for your Schedule C.</p>\n\n<h2>Quick Math</h2>\n\n<p>Let's say you're missing just $200/month in trackable deductions because you lost receipts or forgot to claim something.</p>\n\n<p>That's $2,400/year in missed deductions.</p>\n\n<p>At a 22% tax bracket, you're paying $528 more in taxes than you need to.</p>\n\n<p>Every year.</p>\n\n<p>For receipts you already earned the right to deduct—you just couldn't prove it.</p>\n\n<h2>Stop leaving money on the road.</h2>\n\n<p>TextExpense gives you 3 free receipts to try. Text a photo, get it organized, see how it works.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wa.me/17654792054?text=hi\" class=\"cta-link\">Try It Free →</a></p>",
